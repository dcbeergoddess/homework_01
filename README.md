# Need to Work On

Got rid of a ton of div tags. But need to spend some more time wrapping my head around the uses of div, container, section and how to make life easier when linking to the CSS and seperating elements in the body. 

Attempted to change the CSS to correspond with my id and class changes. tried some color changes for the logo to make seo stand out and make it uniform. 

I threw an index.html file into a seperate folder within assets just so I could open it without it being linked to any assests.
